#LLD Low Level Design
Low-Level Design is the detailed design phase in the software development lifecycle, where developers define how individual components/modules of a system will work. It focuses on implementation-level details based on the high-level design (HLD)

## main focus
1. Scalability
- Design components to handle growth in users, data, or transactions without performance degradation
2. Maintainablity
- Ensure the codebase is modular, well-structured, and easy to update or debug
3. Re-usability
- Encourage the development of generic, loosely coupled components that can be reused across the system or in future projects 
- plug and play

## What is not LLD?
 ###  HLD : high level design
- TechStack (React/Angular/Vue/...etc)
- DB (Sql /nosql/....etc)
- Server Scale
- Cost Optimization

 DSA is the brain of an Application, LLD is the skelaton and HLD is blueprint

# ULM Unified Modeling Language
Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized modeling language used in software engineering to visualize, specify, construct, and document the artifacts of a software system. It provides a set of graphical notation techniques to create abstract models of systems, also known as blueprints.


Key Aspects of UML
Standardized: Maintained by the Object Management Group (OMG).

Platform-Independent: Not tied to any specific programming language.

Visual Language: Uses diagrams to represent systems.


UML is divided into two main categories of diagrams:

## 1. Structural Diagrams – Focus on the static aspects of the system.
### Class Diagram: Shows classes and relationships.

Object Diagram: Instances of classes at a point in time.

Component Diagram: Software components and dependencies.

Deployment Diagram: Physical deployment of artifacts on nodes.

Package Diagram: Organization of packages.

Composite Structure Diagram: Internal structure of classes.

Profile Diagram: Customization for specific domains.

## 2. Behavioral Diagrams – Focus on dynamic behavior.
Use Case Diagram: Functional requirements and actors.

### Sequence Diagram: Object interactions in time order.

Activity Diagram: Workflows and business processes.

State Machine Diagram: States and transitions.

Communication Diagram: Interactions organized by structure.

Interaction Overview Diagram: High-level control flow.

Timing Diagram: Behavior of objects over time.

# Class Diagram
- Class Structure
- Association/ connection

- class diagram part
1. class name
2. characters/variable
3. Behaviours/methods

**Example** 
1. class name
    Car
------------------------    
2. Variable
    brand:string
    model:string
    enginecc:int
-------------------------
3. Behaviours
    startEngine():void
    stopEngine():void
    accelerate():void
    brake():void

- '+' public
- '#' protected
- '-' private
- above diagram if '<<abstract>>' is written it having virtual method
## Association
1. class association
    1.1 Inheritance

2. Object Association
2.1 Simple association
2.2 Aggregation
2.3 composition
